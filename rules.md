# Ingestion rules for books CSV files

Agreed by Alex Bertelli and Fernando Martinez (Module 4, MSAI-5523).

These rules are the only source of truth for `ingest.py`. Anything not written here is not allowed. The script uses no AI and no internet. The same file on the same database always gives the same result.

## 1. What a valid ISBN is

- **ISBN-10:** exactly 10 characters. The first nine are digits; the last is a digit or `X`. It is valid when the sum of each character times its weight (weights 10 down to 1, `X` = 10) is divisible by 11.
- **ISBN-13:** exactly 13 digits starting `978` or `979`. It is valid when the sum of each digit times its weight (weights alternate 1, 3, 1, 3…) is divisible by 10.
- A value is valid only if it passes its checksum. The right length alone is not enough.

## 2. Normalization (always first, never logged)

Before any check, both `isbn` and `isbn13` are normalized:

- strip leading and trailing whitespace
- remove internal spaces and hyphens
- upper-case a lower-case `x`

This is formatting, not a change of value. It is not a repair and is not logged.

## 3. Repairs (logged as warnings)

A repair is allowed only when the original value can be rebuilt **exactly** and the result **passes its checksum**. Every repair is logged as a warning on the row, with the value before and after. These are the only repairs:

| Problem | Repair |
|---|---|
| ISBN-10 with exactly **9** digits (one leading zero lost) | Add one leading zero. Keep it only if the checksum passes. |
| `isbn13` written as a float (`9.78043902348e+12`) | Discard the float; its last digits are lost. Derive the ISBN-13 from a valid ISBN-10. |
| `isbn13` empty, ISBN-10 valid | Derive the ISBN-13 from the ISBN-10 (`978` + first nine digits + new check digit). |
| Valid ISBN-13 in the `isbn` column, `isbn13` empty | Move it to `isbn13`. |
| ISBN-10 empty, ISBN-13 valid and starting `978` | Derive the ISBN-10 from the ISBN-13. |
| ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 both valid but they **disagree** | `isbn13` wins. The ISBN-10 is discarded and derived again from the ISBN-13 (no ISBN-10 if it starts `979`). The warning names the discarded value. |

Any fix that means choosing a digit is a guess: correcting a bad checksum, replacing a letter, padding more than one zero, or deciding which of 11 digits is extra. The code never guesses.

## 4. ISBNs that can't be fixed: load the row, no ISBN, warning

If an ISBN value is still invalid after normalization and the repairs in rule 3, the **row is still loaded**. Its ISBN fields are stored as NULL, and a warning is logged with the original value and the reason. This covers:

- a checksum that fails on a 10- or 13-character value
- a letter anywhere except a final `X`
- the wrong length: fewer than 9 digits, 11 or 12 digits, or 13 digits not starting `978`/`979`
- an `isbn13` that is neither a 13-digit value nor an `e+12` float (for example `76783609419.0`)
- a float `isbn13` with no valid ISBN-10 to derive from
- both ISBN fields empty (warning `no ISBN`)

If only one value is unfixable and the other is valid, keep the valid one and derive the other from it (rule 3). The warning names the discarded value.

## 5. Identity: what makes two rows the same book

- **`book_id` is the key.** Two rows with the same `book_id` are the same book. A row with no usable ISBN is still a book.
- **No two books may share an ISBN.** If a row's valid ISBN-13 already belongs to a different `book_id`, either in the database or earlier in the same file, the row is **still loaded**. Its ISBN fields are stored as NULL, with the warning `ISBN already assigned to book <id>`.

## 6. Rejections: the row is never loaded

A row is rejected, counted, and listed in the log with its reason only when:

1. **`book_id` is missing or the title is blank.** There is nothing to key or name the record.
2. **It is an exact duplicate of an earlier row in the same file** (same `book_id` and identical in every column). The first copy is processed; the second is rejected as `duplicate row in file`.
3. **It is a re-delivery that changes the title or author** (rule 7). It is rejected as `collision: title or author changed for book <id>`, and the stored row is left unchanged.

Nothing else is rejected.

## 7. Re-delivery: a book already in the database arrives again

- Compare the incoming row with the stored row column by column, after normalization and repairs.
- **Nothing changed:** the row is `skipped`. This is not an error.
- **Title or author changed:** the row is rejected as a collision (rule 6.3). Nothing is written.
- **Anything else changed:** the stored columns are overwritten and the row is counted as `updated`. The log lists the columns that changed.
- **An empty incoming ISBN never blanks a stored ISBN.** If the incoming row has no usable ISBN and the stored row has one, the stored ISBN is kept. The row is otherwise updated, or skipped if nothing else changed.
- A second row in the same file with the same `book_id` but different content is a re-delivery. It is compared against what the first row just loaded.
- Running the same file twice therefore gives zero new and zero updated rows the second time; every row is `skipped`.

## 8. Database

- SQLite file `books.db` with one table, `books`, whose primary key is `book_id`.
- Columns:
  - every column from the CSV
  - `isbn10` and `isbn13` (normalized, repaired, or NULL)
  - `isbn_raw` and `isbn13_raw`: exactly what the file had under those headers
  - `last_source_file` and `last_loaded_at`
- A UNIQUE index on `isbn13` (where not NULL) enforces rule 5.

## 9. The log and the report

Every run appends one entry to `ingestion-log.json`. The file is created if missing, and earlier entries are never overwritten. Each entry has:

- `run_at` (ISO timestamp), `source_file`, `rows_read`
- the counts `loaded` (new), `updated`, `skipped` and `rejected`, where loaded + updated + skipped + rejected = `rows_read`
- `rejected_rows`: every row not loaded, with `book_id`, `title`, the raw `isbn` and `isbn13`, and a `reason` sentence naming the problem and the value
- `warnings`: every loaded or updated row that had a repair or an unfixable ISBN, with `book_id`, `title`, `field`, `before`, `after` and `reason`
- `database_totals` after the run: total books, books with an ISBN-13, and books without any ISBN

`report.html` is a single file that opens from disk with no server. It reads `ingestion-log.json` and shows the runs newest first: the counts, the rejected rows with reasons, the repairs (before → after), the warnings, and the database totals.
